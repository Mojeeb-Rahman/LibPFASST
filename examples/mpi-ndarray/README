LIBPFASST mpi-ndarray
=====================

This example encompases several PDEs:

#. 1d advection/diffusion
#. 1d heat equation
#. 1d viscous burgers
#. 1d wave equation (2nd order)
#. 1d KS
#. 2d shear

This directory also contains several other files:

* ks-convergence.py: A Python script to plot error-vs-time for the KS
  equation.

* ks-anim.py: A Python script to create a movie of the KS equation.


Timing analysis
---------------

The examples contained in mpi-ndarray were used to analyse PFASST
speedup and efficiency in "A parallel full approximation scheme in
space and time" by Emmett and Minion.

To reproduce the results therein:

$ cd libpfasst/examples/mpi-ndarray
$ fab -H edison build:mpi-ndarray
$ fab -H edison build:mpi-navier-stokes
$ fab -H edison timings
$ fab -H edison pull:timings
$ python timings.py



Notes
-----

* 2013-10-29

  I ran the heat, burgers, and ks examples on edison without any
  specialized cpus.  From the generated boxplots it seems as though
  communication is slowing things down a bit compared to some
  quick'n'dirty runs using specialized cpus from yesterday.

  The timing info for these runs is in 'timings/edison.r0'.

  I would like to try again with specialized cpus (using 'aprun -r X')
  but with setting those ugly environment variables to see if I can
  recover the nice results from yesterday.
