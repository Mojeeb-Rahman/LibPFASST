* Run `hostname` and rename "<path-to-project>/host/hostname.mk" to "<path-to-project>/host/<hostname>.mk", where "<hostname>" is the output from `hostname`

* Update all occurrences of "<hostname>" in "<path-to-project>/Makefile" using your hostname

* Adjust all variables in "<path-to-project>/host/hostname.mk" and then run `make`

* Usage example is `cd <path-to-project>/out; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$my_HDF5_DIR"/lib:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"; <path-to-mpi>/mpiexec -n <N> <path-to-project>/main <path-to-project>/arg/pfasst.txt num_rank_time=<N> num_rank_space=1,1;`
