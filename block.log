Steps to make a new block controller:

1.  Removed the communications helpers to to a new module called pf_comm.f90
   -  Add pf_comm.o to Makefile.defaults and Makefile.rules  (should clean both up and automate dependencies)

2.  Removed the oc to a new module called pf_parallel_oc.f90
   -  Add pf_parallel_oc to Makefile.defaults and Makefile.rules
      (should clean both up and automate dependencies)

3. Changed the check on the residual to not have the stupid type of rel_res_tol.
   -  Changed residual0 in the pf_level_t structure to residual_rel
   -  Changed the utils routine to scale residual_rel by norm of solution
   -  Changed the test to compare to  residual_rel
   -  Made a separate routine to just check residual for cleanness

4. Cleaned up the logic in check_convergence considerably in check_convergence_block
   -  This is the only place that send and receive status are called so there is no logic in the comm routines for these
   -  Changed the interface to be much cleaner

5.  Removed state%cycle

6. Put the stuff directly before v_cycle into v_cycle

7.  I took the conditional  .and. pf%state%status == PF_STATUS_ITERATING out of pf_send.  Since send is used in the predictor, this
can't be correct
