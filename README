LIBPFASST
=========

LIBPFASST is a lightweight implementation of the Parallel Full
Approximation Scheme in Space and Time (PFASST) algorithm.  It is
written in Fortran (mostly F90, with some F03), but can be interfaced
with C and C++ fairly easily.

Please see the documentation in 'docs' and examples in 'examples' for
usage information.
